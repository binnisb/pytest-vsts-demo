# Pytest - Coverage with Docker on Visual Studio Team Service

In VSTS, clone this repository to get started. Import `Demo.json` as build instructions and update the missing fields. 
It will create a build instruction that runs pytest with coverage and formats the output to be used in VSTS tools to 
visualise coverage and test results.
